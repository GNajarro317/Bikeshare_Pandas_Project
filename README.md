### Project Title
Bikeshare Data Project

### Description
In this project, I had to utilize pandas library to examine data connected with bike share systems in Chicago, New York City, and Washington in the US. I had to write code to retrieve the data and answer questions about it by quantifing statistics, and writing a dialogue that takes in input to create an interactive experience in the terminal that presented these statistics.

The program provides the following information:

* Most popular month, day, and hour
* Most popular start station and end station
* Most popular combination of start and end stations
* Total trip duration and average trip duration
* Types of users by number and by gender
* The oldest user and youngest user
* The most common birth year amongst users
